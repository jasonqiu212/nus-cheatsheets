## Can I customize the notes?

**Yes!** Everyone has their unique way of learning and interpretation of academic concepts. Thus, please feel free to modify the source code I provided.

I use 2 methods to take notes:

### LaTeX

> Format inspired by [jovyntls/cheatsheets](https://github.com/jovyntls/cheatsheets)

1. Download the `.tex` file and the `/img` folder with the original images in the cheatsheet.
2. Use LaTeX to edit and render the PDF file (I recommend using VS Code).

### Obsidian

> [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a neat note-taking app using Markdown

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Download the `.md` file and the `/img` folder with the original images in the cheatsheet.
3. Copy the above files into your vault.
4. Use Obsidian to edit and export the cheatsheet into a PDF file.

## I found a mistake! Can I report it?

**Yes please!** If you found a mistake (e.g. typo), please feel free to submit an issue on this GitHub repository. I will fix it asap!
