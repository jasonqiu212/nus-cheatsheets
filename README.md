## Can I customize the notes?

**Yes!** Everyone has their unique way of learning and interpretation of academic concepts. Thus, please feel free to re-use the source code I provided.

I use 2 methods to take notes:

### LaTeX

> Format inspired by [jovyntls/cheatsheets](https://github.com/jovyntls/cheatsheets)

1. Download the `.tex` file and the `/img` folder with the original images in the cheatsheet.
2. Use LaTeX to render to edit and render the PDF file (I recommend using VS Code).

### Obsidian

> [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a neat note-taking app using Markdown

1. Download the `.md` file and the `/img` folder with the original images in the cheatsheet.
2. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
3. Copy the above files into your vault.
4. Use Obsidian to edit and export the cheatsheet into a PDF file.
